# Build a Platform Based on Makecode
Based on the microsoft official documnet on [Makecode](https://makecode.com/docs)  and there might be some difference from the original one.


# Whole Picture
**1. Platform** Focus on user-facing. User can use blocks or javascript to design their own code and workflow. </br>
**2. PXT** For developers. PXT developers are group of people who can change the block totally, not like users can only change certain part of the block. 


## Makecode General Information
Microsoft Makecode is based on the open source project [Microsoft Programming Experience Toolkit(PXT)](https://github.com/Microsoft/pxt). Microsoft is the name in the user-facing editors, ```PXT``` is used in all the GitHub sources
